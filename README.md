# Ghibli Movies App

Do you love Ghibli movies?  
In this app, you can compare the English version with the original (Japanese) one.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript(vanilla), Node.js(to use serverless function on Netlify)

## Optimizations

I suppose for those who are big fans of Ghibli movies and want to learn English or Japanese, this app may be a good option for learning a language.
  
Like:  
"spirit away" in English --> "神隠し" in Japanese  
"princess" in English --> "姫" in Japanese  

When I improve this app, I would add a dictionary function that can compare/translate English with Japanese.
  
## Lessons Learned:

I learned **OOP** and **async/await, promise** while creating this app.  
I built this app with OOP concept (especially encapsulation) to create an English version object and a Japanese one.  
If there is some need to add movie items to this app, it would be easy to change the codes.

## Future plan:

I'd like to deploy this app to Netlify.
1. I need to hide my API key.
2. I need to learn backend like Node.js  
Once the right timing is coming, I'm sure to try it out!
